Week 2 - Lessons Learned - A Dog And Its Bone!

Responsibilities of an App Developer:
1. Understand the initial thought process of the
overall App Design.
2. Interpret the App Design vision into computer
language with QA testing.
3. Produce a functional user friendly experience app to the
end-user.

Learning the hardship of time-management and planning of the Control Flow are
a couple of critical key factors in being a good Developer. Sometimes your
thought process may look like it will work in both theory and in code, but it
may not be as perceived the same when you produce your app.
You may feel just like this dog in
[SilkeCaproens video](https://www.facebook.com/SilkeCaproens/videos/10210730476119101/).
It looks like the bone is there, until you try to get it! This can
be relatable when it comes to code writing and as an end-user.
As a coder...it is our job to keep trying to make the bone real. As a end-user
...the bone must be real.

This is a good lesson for the code developer to realize. If the code is not
what the user is expecting, than the user will only try so long before they
give up and will no longer access your app. Then the great grape-vine of
negative feedback begins.

BE THE END USER and you will BE A BETTER CODER!!!

WARNING - You can easily have tunnel vision on an issue that you
Bull Dog the project. Learn to take a moment to let go of the code bone.
Your virtual jaw will thank you. :)
