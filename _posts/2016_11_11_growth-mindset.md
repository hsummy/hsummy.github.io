<h1>Fixed vs. Growth
<h2>Two Mindsets - Dr. Carol Dweck

With listening to videos about two mindsets by Dr. Dweck and learning 
anything Khan Academy, it dawned on me that challenging oneself is not a normal
thought process or feeling by everyone. The *Fixed Mindset* for some is a 
comfortable low-risk zone, but at the same time scary. The *Growth Mindset*
for some is a comfortable high-risk zone, but at the same time scary. Both 
sharing the common denominator of fear with two different results. Where
fear is a deterrent for most, it can be a tool for motivation.

*Fixed Mindset* can be advantageous for many reasons. It can be steady, 
straight-forward, and reliable. *Fixed Mindset* know their boundaries and 
stick to what they know. They can repeat the pattern of success by knowing
their limits. The downside to *Fixed Mindset* is they may 
not challenge themselves very often to avoid feeling failure. 
This will result in limits and lack of flexibility in many areas.

*Growth Mindset* can be advantageous for many reasons also. It can be 
spontaneous, limitless, and open-minded. *Growth Mindset* know no boundaries and
are challenged by what they do not know. They can repeat the pattern of
success by knowing there are no limits. The downside to *Growth Mindset* is 
they may challenge themselves too often and may result in lack of focus.
 
While both Mindsets can produce positive results in life, I definitely 
identify with the *Growth Mindset*. With this week's historical election, I 
find it quit appropriate that growth is the theme for this week. No matter
what choices we make, I would rather have many choices of growth
than not to be challenged at all. We have many choices as [Kid President 
has said] (https://www.facebook.com/KidPresident/videos/764957420311575/),
and I choose to be someone worth following. I am always challenging myself and
I am happy to have the thought process of growth and positive encouragement from
my cohort. With many obstacles to conquer, I face them with the *fear of motivation* and *Not Yet*
attitude!

Be Brave my friends! [Kid President can help you with some dancing to help :)]
