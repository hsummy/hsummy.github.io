<h1>Auto Layout - Harnessing Constraints (without Stacking)<h1>

This tutorial is under the assumption that you have prior
knowledge of creating a new project in Xcode. We will be creating
a Single View project in a ViewController. The tutorial will be based on iOS 10
and available in both Objective-C and Swift, as the following Constraints are not
limited to either. We will be inserting one Table View, one Label, and four
Buttons within a View Controller.
- StoryBoard
  - Insert Objects
  - Add Constraints
  - Align Menu
  - Update Constraints


Create a Single View Xcode project with a basic View Controller before beginning
the following instructions for the StoryBoard. Confirm your Project Navigator is
open on the left panel, the View Controller is on the center panel and the
Inspector is on the right panel.

<h2>StoryBoard<h2>

 Click the View Controller icon button (yellow icon top of View Controller) to
 confirm you are activating the proper screen. This step is more important when
 you have multiple Views. It is a great practice to adopt. We will insert the
 Table View first, then the Label, followed by the four Buttons. Do not worry
 exact position in the initial instructions as we will use the Constraints to
 our advantage.

  <h3>Insert Objects<h3>
  <h4>Table View<h4>

  Let us begin by inserting the Table View. Go to the Object Library (second
  button from the right) located in the lower right-hand corner of your
  Inspector panel. Type in "Table" in the search field. A list of Objects with
  "Table" will appear. Click and drag "Table View" into the center of the View
  Controller (Note: You can also type "Table View" and hit Return. This will
  automatically put it in the View Controller. Careful with this option as it
  can get complicated with more Objects in your Controller).
  <h4>Label<h4>

  Go to the Object Library and type in "Label" in the search field. "Label"
  will appear. Click and drag "Label" into the center of the View
  Controller, but place it above Table View.
  <h4>Button<h4>

  Go to the Object Library and type in "Button" in the search field. A list of
  Objects with "Button" will appear. Click and drag "Button" into the
  center of the View Controller but place it below Table View. Bring in three
  more buttons into the screen and position them generally two in one row and
  other two row below (forming a box layout).
  <h3>Add Constraints<h3>

  Click on Label, then click Add New Constraints icon in lower right of center
  panel (Hint: hover over icon). Type in 30 in upper constraint box, and 15 in
  left and right constraints. Click Add Constraints (orange lines will appear).
  Click Update Frames to update Label. We will be using the Label as our anchor
  for the other Objects. (HINT: change Background Color to see easier when
  running app).

  Click on Table View and use Ctrl+Click+Drag to connect to the Label. Select
  Hold down the Command key and select Leading, Trailing, and Equal Widths.
