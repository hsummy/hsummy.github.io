<h2>Question: "Who Do You See in the Laptop Screen?"

My laptop is a 'part of me' as it has felt pain, fatigue, and strain as well
as pleasure, strength, and relief. Hence, my ying and yang appendage has a name
called Xcode. I look into my laptop EVERY DAY and am surprised what I see each
time. I see doubt and confidence simultaneously. With my reading glasses affixed
to my nose, blood shot eyes glaring, and fingers feverishly tapping, I have
become one with my silver and black cerebral learning prosthetic. It shows me the
good, bad, and ugly of myself, which has been quite enlightening, but not inclusive.

I have been asked to share my journey of self-reflection on my experience
over the last few months with iOS Bootcamp. The first thing you may think is 'fear of failure',
but for me was 'change'.
Welcoming 'change' throughout my life has brought mixed experiences, but always positive
in the end. Most people do not like change. I actually welcome it most of the time,
but I am still human. Changing over the last few months was not surprising as it has
caused another evolution of myself. I have evolved with more knowledge of technology,
people, logical and analytical thinking, and sometimes the simple task of just breathing.
It has truly been a balance with old habits broken, new
habits made, and 'the jury is still out' with other habits.

I have been hit over the head with a mental sledge-hammer of Xcode Objective-C
and Swift languages. The 'stars' I see are a fusion of clouded understanding,
the luminosity of light by brain synapses, and waves of liquid life called espresso.
Surrendering to 'trust the process' was my biggest challenge. Many concepts
to grasp, languages to learn, and processes to follow, which all will hopefully come
full circle at the end of the 12-week course...again 'trust the process' is hard even
though I have been in other type of situations with successful outcomes.

While some expectations of the Bootcamp were carefully planned by me, some things
will surprise you as it did me and will be different for everyone.
I typically do not like using the words 'never'
and 'always', but with confidence I can honestly say...I 'never' expected the
fatigue and 'always' will appreciate the priceless knowledge gained. Everyone has
their own journey and I am positive this 'blip on my radar' is part of mine.

Being asked to reflect on the positive and negative experience, over the last few
months, stumped me. I had to look at myself both inside and out, and what I
concluded...do not wait until the end to look in the mirror to seek out your
'change'...learn in the beginning that you can...
